### Notes

- Did not have a normal dev environment so apologies if there are some formatting issues as this was all done on Codesandbox
- AI Usage:
  - Used to help figure out items like generating an SVG and the math required to calculate how much of the timer to display
  - Used to help fill out edge cases on testing to achieve 100% test coverage
